# Media Queries

Expressions we can add to our code that modify our website based on characteristics of the device that it's being viewed on.

135 device sizes

Different devices will display our code differently.

Media queries with breakpoints.

What are **breakpoints**?
The ```viewport``` width at which we want our design to change.

Writing code within a media query, with a set breakpoint, we want to go into effect only when the viewport width the app is being viewed on is at least the breakpoint width.

Only the CSS that we want to change goes there. The original CSS rules still apply, only the new CSS rules written within the media query will override any pre-existing rules. 


What is **viewport**?
The area of the window in which web content can be seen. We use the dimensions of the viewport(usually the width, but sometimes the height) as the basis of our media queries.

Mobile-ready site then develop to a big website.
