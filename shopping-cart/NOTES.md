Plan:

1. Review the started code - do all work in file script.js
2. Build the products - test and confirm all aspects fo the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
3. Create the cart functionality - test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
4. Create the checkout functionality - test and confirm all aspects of the user interface are working. Fix the code as needed.
5. Refactor your code - to improve its appearance and functionality
6. Test before submission - should be testing as we build, it's always good to do one or more tests before submitting the project.
- Review the project Rubric to ensure all requirements are met.
