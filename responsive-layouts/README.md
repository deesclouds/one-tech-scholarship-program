# Responsive Layouts with Grid

CSS Grid allows us to create simple, elegant and professional quality webpage designs.

## Creating Responsive Layouts
**A Simple Blog Page**

CSS Grid can be used to setup multiple displays within a single site. 

Demo used CSS Grid to create a blog home page and an individual page for blog posts.

Separate pages within a web app can be stored in the same folder and linked to each other using ```<a>``` tags to create links with the name of the file as the target.

```index.html``` could use the following code to link to another file in the same directory name ```go.html```

```<a href='go.html'>Go to page</a>```
