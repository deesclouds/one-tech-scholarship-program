// Semicolons

// Directions: define two variables called thingOne and thingTwo and assign them values. Print both values. Print the values of both in one console.log using concatenation. 

// Ex: "red" is the value of thingOne and "blue" is the value of thingTwo. Don't forget to use semicolon at the end of each statement!

// When running code enter node semicolons.js into the terminal.

const thingOne = "Rosie";
const thingTwo = "Molly";

console.log(thingOne + " " + thingTwo);
