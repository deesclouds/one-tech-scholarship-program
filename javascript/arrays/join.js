Quiz: Joining the Crew
Directions:
In an earlier exercise, you created a crew array to represent Malâ€™s crew from the hit show Firefly.

const captain = "Mal";
const second = "Zoe";
const pilot = "Wash";
const companion = "Inara";
const mercenary = "Jayne";
const mechanic = "Kaylee";

const crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];
Later in the show, Mal takes on three new crew members named "Simon", "River", and "Book". Use the push() method to add the three new crew members to the crew array.

const doctor = "Simon";
const sister = "River";
const shepherd = "Book";
