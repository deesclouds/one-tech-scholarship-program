# Conditionals

We Write Code to Solve Problems:

When we writing code, we break down problems into steps that are executed by a computer. 

These steps are known as an algorithm.

Ex: Purchase Algorithm

Steps we need to take to decide whether or not to purchase an item. 

1. Do I want the item?
2. Do I have enough money to purchase the item?

If yes to both questions we'll purchase the item. 

The process we went through to solve that problem and the steps taken to do so, is at the heart of writing code.
